Personal statements:

Hayley:
	I very much enjoyed working with such a diverse, skilled group of like-minded people. I was going to give special thanks to specific team members, but then I realized I'd be thanking every single one of you. Thank you all for listening to my ideas, solving the problems I caused, and making me feel like a welcome and important member of the group. I think we've really made something special that could only come about through this kind of open collaboration and I'm so glad to have played a role in creating it.
