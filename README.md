Personal statements:
-------------------

Hayley:
	I very much enjoyed working with such a diverse, skilled group of like-minded people. I was going to give special thanks to specific team members, but then I realized I'd be thanking every single one of you. Thank you all for listening to my ideas, solving the problems I caused, and making me feel like a welcome and important member of the group. I think we've really made something special that could only come about through this kind of open collaboration and I'm so glad to have played a role in creating it.

Candice:
	This is my first group project working with the people the same year as me in ITWS and I am so glad I did. These people are kind, patient, and hard-working. It has been a wonderful experience to learn more about PHP, Foundation, etc., and how to program with some really talented people. I am genuinely proud of what we accomplished and what we created over the semester.

Lauren:
	This is honestly one of the best teams I have ever worked on. Besides getting bullied by Chris and Candice occassionaly (jokingly of course... i think), we got along great the entire project. We fought through endless merge conflicts, fatal errors, styling issues and tears while trying to fix everything we broke to create a pretty cool application. Everyone contributed what they were assigned to do and we had no issues with people not attending meetings or communicating. I learned a lot about Foundation, CSS, HTML etc. and even refined my skills a little in PHP.I will miss all my teammates and it's been an absolute privelage to be part of Team Snapchat-Roulette <3 
	
Alex:
	I still don’t believe that Plotka didn’t craft this teem (pun intended) himself. I had an awesome semester with a group of people who proved time and time again that they were rock solid people and contributors. Not sure how groups are made for Capstone, but if its random I hope it get the same seed that this random generation had.
